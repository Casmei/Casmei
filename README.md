Hi, my name is Tiago de Castro and I am 21 years old. I currently live in Almenara-MG and I am in the 6th semester of Systems Analysis and Development at IFNMG - Almenara campus.

I have been focusing my studies on backend development in PHP and Typescript, using structural concepts to decouple layers. I always strive to apply my knowledge to real projects present on this GitHub. I see programming as an active means to change the world, and I get excited about solving problems and seeing the impact on end users.
    
ðŸ”¹  Currently learning English and improving my skills in PHP and Javascript :)
